# Zhuwen (朱文) — Chinese by Reading

[![factory-ci](https://github.com/johnarleyburns/parso-zhuwen/actions/workflows/factory-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/johnarleyburns/parso-zhuwen/actions/workflows/factory-ci.yml)

Provably-comprehensible Mandarin reading & listening app. Every story surfaced to a
learner is ≥98% words they already know; the ≤2% new words are deliberately chosen
frontier words (Hu & Nation 98% coverage; Krashen i+1). See
[`00-requirements-and-design.md`](00-requirements-and-design.md) and
[`01-agentic-handoff.md`](01-agentic-handoff.md).

| MC-4 | **Docs truth-up**: monorepo decision record, CP-01 10-vs-20 note, `internal/brief`/`gen` tests, this table | ✅ done |

**Revised remaining order (post-MC-4):** CP-08a (images + Foundations) → CP-08 (already
landed) → CP-09 (content scale-up, opened by importing `plans/mc-2-spike-report.md`) → CP-10.

**Works today:** the Go factory builds a signed 10-story fixture pack from the embedded
canon registry and verifies it (I1 + I6 enforced and tested). The iOS `ZhuwenPacks`
package verifies that pack in Swift (minisign + hashes + content-level I6), rejects the
golden negatives, and `ReaderModel` renders a story with tap-to-gloss. `ZhuwenCore` now
carries the learner engine: an append-only event log, a replayable `KnownWordModel`, a
`FrontierQueue`, the on-device `CoverageGate` (I1), and a `Selector` that gates + scores the
story lattice by bitmap AND + popcount (NFR-2: 5,000 stories in ~13 ms under `make bench`).
The coverage gate shares **one vector suite** with the Go reference gate
(`ios/Fixtures/gate-vectors.json`) so I1 cannot drift between the two implementations. The
**placement** flow (M1–M3) samples an HSK×frequency word check with pseudoword foils, fits a
logistic knowledge curve (guessing-corrected), and produces a conservative probabilistic
**seed** of `KnownWordModel` plus CEFR/HSK estimates; re-placement merges without destroying
prior state (FR-1.5) and simulated learners recover their HSK band within ±1. The **listening**
layer (CP-06) ships word-level `alignment` in packs (a deterministic factory forced-alignment
stage; real CosyVoice render is CP-09) and a `ZhuwenAudio` karaoke engine whose
position→token resolver keeps highlight drift **<120 ms over a 3-minute story** (asserted by
`KaraokeDriftTests`), with speeds 0.6×–1.2×, blind mode, and a labeled on-device system-TTS
fallback (FR-5). The **loop-completion** layer (CP-07) closes the read→check→review→track cycle:
a comprehension check (M8) grades the pack's 3 questions and, on ≥2/3, stamps the 读完为证 **seal**
and boosts P(known) for every exposed word; an on-device **FSRS-4.5** scheduler (M9) surfaces due
words as sentence-context cards (capped 20/day) whose grades fold into per-word memory; and a
Progress dashboard (M10) reports **separate** reading and listening CEFR estimates (blind listens
feed the listening band only), lexicon growth, and the HSK-3.0 gap. The known-word model stays a
replayable projection of the append-only log — including FSRS state — and **P(known) updates are
verified for the exposure / lookup / grade paths**. The **commerce & data** layer (CP-08) adds the
app's *only* network surface — a `PackClient` in `ZhuwenPacks` that downloads additional band packs
over an **anonymous, ephemeral** CDN GET and **verifies them (minisign + hashes + I6) before
installing** (a tampered download is rejected, nothing lands on disk), backing a size/delete/
re-download pack manager — plus **StoreKit 2** SKUs ($7.99/mo · $59.99/yr + 30-day trial · $149.99
lifetime, no receipt server) behind a pure `FeatureGate` (free = the full method at one story/day;
Pro removes the throttle and opens the lattice), a single dismissible **paywall** (M12), a
**settings** screen (M13, FR-10.1 toggles + pack manager + privacy page), **export everything
(JSON) / erase / import** (FR-10.3 — the learner archive is just the ordered event log + seed, so
`export→erase→import` round-trips the exact `KnownWordModel`), and an **opt-in, off-by-default**
private-CloudKit sync of learner state only. `URLSession` is confined to `PackClient` and enforced
by a `grep-audit.sh` network-surface gate (no third-party SDKs, no `http://`, no secrets in
UserDefaults — invariant I2). All of
this is covered by `swift test`. Generation uses a deterministic fixture provider (real LLM
retelling is CP-09); pack audio bytes are fixture stubs until the CosyVoice render (CP-09). The
**`@main` app target is now vendored in-repo** (`ios/App`, generated by XcodeGen via `make app` —
no manual Xcode assembly) and the learner event log is **durably persisted** in SwiftData
(`ZhuwenPersistence.PersistentEventLog`): it is append-only and rebuilt by replay at launch, so
I5 is now *persistence-tested* across a process boundary (`LaunchReplayTests`), with a disposable
projection checkpoint keeping cold launch inside the NFR-1 budget for large histories (MC-1).

## Factory — build, run, test

```sh
cd factory

make build        # compile commands into ./bin  (EC-2)
./bin/zhuwenctl lexicon
./bin/zhuwenctl build  --out /tmp/a2.zpack        # signed fixture pack (+ /tmp/a2.zpack.pub)

make test         # unit + integration + e2e (go test ./...)

```

Command reference: `zhuwenctl {lexicon | lexicon ingest | segment eval | spike | run | build | verify | keygen | authored check | audit}` —
run `zhuwenctl` with no args for usage. The real **HSK-3.0 lexicon** ships in-repo under
`factory/data/hsk3.0/` (12,283 forms, exact per-level mapping; redistribution authorized —
see `factory/data/README.md`) and is built with `zhuwenctl lexicon ingest --src data/hsk3.0
--out lexicon.sqlite --version hsk3.0-v1` (regenerable via `cmd/hskingest`). The `spike --live`
path reads `ZHUWEN_LLM_API_KEY` or `~/.deepseek-api-key` and is never exercised in CI (the
constrained **fixture** provider is the hermetic stand-in — it reproduces gate-passing stories at
A2 and B1 in `make ci`). CP-09a flags: `--oversample <N>` (rerank candidates/story),
`--max-tokens <T>` (per-story ceiling), `--naive` (MC-2 single-candidate baseline). Pack
format is documented in [`factory/PACK_FORMAT.md`](factory/PACK_FORMAT.md).

## iOS — build and test

SPM packages live under `ios/`. Pure-Swift logic (packs, core models) is testable on macOS
without a simulator:

```sh
cd ios
make test         # swift test — ZhuwenPacks + ZhuwenCore + ZhuwenAudio + ZhuwenPersistence (unit / integration / e2e vs Fixtures/)
make bench        # NFR-2 selector benchmark under -c release (the 50 ms gate)
make audit        # network-surface CI gate (I2): URLSession only in PackClient, no SDKs / http:// / secrets
make build-ios    # xcodebuild the SwiftUI shell for the iOS 17 simulator
make app          # XcodeGen-generate + build the in-repo @main app (ios/App) for the iOS 17 simulator
make app-test     # run the app XCUITest smoke (launch → read → lookup → relaunch persists); needs a booted sim
```

The durable learner store lives in `ZhuwenPersistence` (SwiftData; macOS 14+ host for `swift test`).
The `@main` app (`ios/App`, XcodeGen) is agent-buildable from a clean clone with `make app`; the
generated `.xcodeproj` is git-ignored. XcodeGen (MIT) is a build-time tool, not a shipped dependency.

See [`ios/README.md`](ios/README.md) for the package breakdown.

## Continuous integration

- **`factory-ci.yml`** (Go) — runs the **full** factory gate `make ci` (`gofmt` + `vet` +
  `go test ./...`, including the `cmd/` e2e and the MC-3 kill-9 work-queue e2e) on Linux for
  every push and PR, uploads the built `zhuwenctl` binary as an artifact, and enforces the
  **DCO sign-off** (`git commit -s`) on every PR commit (MC-0/MC-3). Target < 3 min.
- **`ci.yml`** (iOS) — runs the Swift **unit** subset (`make test-unit`, which also covers the
  `LaunchReplayTests` I5 durability check) plus the network-surface audit on macOS for every
  push/PR, and re-runs the **full** iOS suite (`make test` incl. integration + 50k-replay perf,
  `make bench`, `make audit`) on a **weekly schedule** — the per-PR macOS unit job is kept
  because it is fast; the weekly job is the hosted signal for the heavy suites.
- **Pre-push hook** ([`.githooks/pre-push`](.githooks/pre-push)) still guards the heavier
  **integration/e2e** suites, the NFR-2 benchmark, and the audit locally, so a broken build can
  never be pushed. Enable once per clone:

  ```sh
  git config core.hooksPath .githooks
  ```
- **`testflight.yml`** (iOS) — builds the in-repo `@main` app (`ios/App`) and uploads it to
  **TestFlight** (`guru.parso.zhuwen`) using App Store Connect API **cloud signing** (no
  pre-made provisioning profile). Manual (`gh workflow run testflight.yml`) or on a `v*` tag.
  See [`plans/testflight-done.md`](plans/testflight-done.md).

## Testing philosophy
Every feature ships with unit, integration, and e2e tests. In the factory these are Go
tests (golden-file pipeline, gate property vectors, pack verifier negative suite). Invariants
I1–I6 are enforced in code and covered by must-fail fixtures. The coverage gate (I1) is
verified by a **single shared vector suite** generated by the Go reference gate and run
through both the Go and Swift implementations (`ios/Fixtures/gate-vectors.json`), so the
invariant cannot drift across languages (handoff §7). The known-word model is an append-only
event log with a **replayable** projection (I5), tested for determinism.

## Exit criteria
Each checkpoint must also satisfy the standing criteria in
[`plans/exit-criteria.md`](plans/exit-criteria.md) (this README kept current; `make build`
→ `bin/`; green `make ci`).

## License
**GPLv3 with an App Store additional permission** (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and
[`NOTICE-APP-STORE.md`](NOTICE-APP-STORE.md)). The project is honestly copyleft under the
GNU GPL version 3; a GPLv3 §7 additional permission explicitly authorizes distribution
through Apple's App Store / TestFlight so it can also ship there. Contributions require a
DCO sign-off (`git commit -s`) and are accepted under GPLv3 + that exception — see
